1. Introduction

This action plan outlines the research assignment undertaken by Project Group 3, which consists of the following students: Bianca Burlacu, Wojciech Kolasa, Codrin Calin and Salman Kanj.  Project Group 3 is working on Classifying Arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots for TNO.

F-35 pilots sometimes experience unexplained physiological events (UPEs) during high-G maneuvers, raising concerns about potential physiological anomalies. Accurately distinguishing between genuine arrhythmic events and false alarms is critical for pilot safety and operational effectiveness. To address this, TNO seeks to develop an advanced ECG-based arrhythmia classifier.

This project focuses on improving the reliability of an arrhythmia classification system designed to detect irregular heartbeats in pilots. A key challenge is ensuring the classifier performs well across different domains and sensor types, as ECG measurement conditions may vary.

The goal is to enhance the classifier’s ability to generalize across datasets, ensuring reliable performance even when trained on controlled experiments but applied in real flight conditions. This will be achieved by exploring innovative machine learning approaches that improve domain transfer adaptability.

2. Assignment and background
This section provides an overview of the research assignment, including the problem it seeks to address and its broader context. The objective is to gain insight into the significance of the project and the environment in which it is conducted. The section outlines the assignment issued by the client, as well as the sector, company, and department relevant to the research.

2.1. The assignment issued 

The assignment, issued by TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research), focuses on classifying arrhythmia in F-35 fighter pilots. Pilots sometimes experience unexplained physiological events (UPEs) during high-G maneuvers, raising concerns about potential physiological anomalies. The goal of this research is to develop an advanced ECG-based arrhythmia classifier that can reliably distinguish between actual arrhythmias and false alarms.

The primary challenge is ensuring that the classifier is reliable enough to perform well across different sensor types and measurement conditions. Given that there is limited real-world flight data involving arrhythmic events, the classifier must be trained on controlled experimental data while maintaining high accuracy when applied in real flight conditions. Initial research has shown that traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forests, fail to generalize effectively to new datasets, whereas Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) show better cross-domain adaptability. This project aims to enhance the classifier’s domain transfer stability through innovative machine learning techniques.
2.2. Context of the assignment 

Sector
This research falls within the defense and aerospace sector, specifically focusing on physiological monitoring and aviation safety. Fighter pilots are subjected to extreme physical conditions, particularly during high-G maneuvers, where physiological stress can lead to performance degradation or medical incidents. Ensuring pilot safety is a priority for defense organizations worldwide, making real-time health monitoring a crucial area of research.

A key challenge in this sector is the reliability of physiological monitoring systems. Current ECG-based classifiers often struggle with cross-domain performance due to variations in sensor types, signal noise, and environmental conditions. The ability to create a stable and adaptable classifier will contribute to improved in-flight health monitoring and potentially set new standards for pilot safety protocols.

3. Analysis and Theoretical Exploration

This section will provide a detailed examination of the problem presented in the project, analyze the requirements and context surrounding the task, and explore theoretical sources and research on the relevant topic. This will include understanding the key problem, its stakeholders, and the broader context, as well as reviewing existing literature and research to offer deeper insights into the challenge.
3.1. Analysis of the Assignment
The task at hand involves developing an arrhythmia classifier capable of detecting irregular heartbeats in F-35 pilots during high-stress, high-G manoeuvres. The pilots sometimes report feeling unwell during these manoeuvres, and it is crucial to determine whether this is due to genuine physiological anomalies or is a false alarm caused by sensor or environmental factors. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the classifier must generalize well to different sensors and sensor types, which may change in the future, making it necessary for the algorithm to perform effectively across different datasets.
Problem Description:
The main problem is the inability of current machine learning models to generalize across different domains, sensor types, and activity conditions. The classifier must be able to detect arrhythmic events reliably from ECG data, which is recorded in varying conditions (resting, running, or high-stress flight situations). A significant hurdle is that real-world flight data showing arrhythmias does not exist, so the classifier must be trained and validated using controlled datasets, which may differ from actual flight conditions. Ensuring the classifier’s reliability when moving between different data sources is crucial.

Stakeholders:
F-35 Pilots: They are the most directly affected group. Their safety is the highest priority, as a misdiagnosed arrhythmia could jeopardize their health and mission success.
Dutch Government: Through TNO, the Dutch government has a vested interest in ensuring the safety and performance of its armed forces.
TNO: The organization responsible for addressing this issue through the development of a reliable arrhythmia detection system that can be integrated into the cockpit systems of fighter jets.
ECG Sensor Manufacturers: These companies provide the technology used to collect the physiological data needed for classification, and their devices must be reliable enough to handle the extreme conditions of high-G maneuvers.
Medical Professionals and Flight Medics: They must accurately interpret the data, ensuring that pilots receive appropriate medical attention if a genuine arrhythmic event occurs.
The Client: The client for this project is TNO, who has commissioned the research to develop an arrhythmia classifier that can be used for F-35 pilots. They are looking for solutions that can be implemented in a real-world context, ensuring pilots' safety and maximizing the generalizability of the model.
Other Affected Groups:
Aircraft manufacturers: Manufacturers of the F-35 jet and the cockpit systems will be indirectly affected as they may need to integrate the arrhythmia detection system into the aircraft's operational systems.
Air Force Operations: The operational procedures and health monitoring protocols used during flight may need to adapt if new detection systems are implemented.
Who Will Benefit:
Pilots: They will benefit directly from the improved safety and health monitoring, potentially preventing health incidents during flight.
TNO: Successfully addressing this challenge would reinforce TNO's reputation as a leader in developing innovative and impactful solutions for the defense sector.
Dutch Defense Forces: The safety of pilots during missions will be improved, contributing to the overall effectiveness and safety of the military operations.
ECG Sensor Manufacturers: The demand for more stable and adaptable ECG sensors would rise, prompting innovation in the sensor technology.
Who Might Be Negatively Affected:
Overly Cautious Monitoring Systems: If the classifier is too sensitive, it may lead to false alarms, causing unnecessary panic, interruptions, or even causing pilots to abandon critical missions due to erroneous readings. A poorly optimized system could negatively affect performance in the cockpit.
Manufacturers of Older or Less Reliable ECG Sensors: Manufacturers whose devices do not meet the evolving demands of high-stress environments might lose out on opportunities for integration into defense systems.
When the Problem Arose: The problem has existed as long as fighter pilots have been subject to high-stress, high-G environments. The specific focus on ECG-based arrhythmia detection has become more critical with the increasing complexity and performance demands placed on pilots. The need for real-time health monitoring is amplified as the aircraft systems grow more sophisticated and as pilot safety becomes a top priority in military operations.
What Prompted the Problem: The problem arose from reports by F-35 pilots who sometimes experience unexplained physiological events during high-stress maneuvers. These experiences raised concerns about the pilots' safety and led to the need for a reliable system to monitor heart health during such critical operations.
Why It’s a Problem: This problem is critical because any misdiagnosis could lead to serious health risks for the pilots and potential loss of life. Moreover, if the arrhythmia classifier fails to perform reliably across various scenarios, it might undermine confidence in using ECG-based health monitoring systems in future missions.
Where the Problem Occurs: This problem occurs primarily during high-G maneuvers in F-35 jets, where pilots are subjected to intense physical stress. The data used for training and validating the classifier must come from controlled conditions (e.g., resting or activity-based ECG data) but needs to generalize well to real-world flight conditions, which have higher variability.
Tools to Sharpen the Problem:
Fishbone Diagram: A fishbone diagram can help identify potential causes of the problem, including factors like sensor quality, environmental conditions, pilot stress levels, and data quality. This will give insights into the root causes that affect model performance.
5xWhy: The 5xWhy technique will help drill down to the core issues by repeatedly asking “why” to understand why current models do not generalize well, why pilot health monitoring is critical, and why current solutions are insufficient.

3.2. Theoretical Exploration: Source Research
To deepen our understanding of the problem, a comprehensive literature review is essential. The theoretical exploration will look at relevant existing research, explore possible methodologies for developing the classifier, and examine previous studies and current technological trends in arrhythmia detection.

Action Plan for Finding Sources:
Exploring Similar Problems: There are several studies that have explored arrhythmia detection from ECG signals. Many of these focus on detecting arrhythmias in resting or semi-active states, but very few focus on high-stress or high-G environments, which is a key gap.
Use of PhysioNet: The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database on PhysioNet offers an excellent starting point for developing a classifier in a controlled environment. From there, we can explore research on transferring models to new environments, like exercise or flight scenarios.
Searching for Key Sources: We will search for articles, books, and white papers on:
Arrhythmia detection techniques in medical diagnostics.
The use of machine learning and signal processing in ECG classification.
Techniques for improving cross-domain generalization in machine learning.
Studies on the effects of high-G forces on human health, particularly on cardiac function.
Important Concepts and Insights:
ECG Signal Processing: Filtering, feature extraction, and noise reduction are key aspects that can significantly improve classification performance.
Machine Learning Techniques: SVMs, Random Forests, and newer deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for arrhythmia detection. However, techniques for ensuring generalization across sensor types, noise conditions, and environments are under-researched.
Domain Transfer in Machine Learning: Techniques like transfer learning and domain adaptation are important when applying models trained on controlled data to real-world flight conditions.
Current Trends in Pilot Health Monitoring: As aviation technology advances, so does the need for more reliable and unobtrusive health monitoring systems for pilots, which is driving research into real-time monitoring solutions.
Previous Research and Existing Solutions:
Existing Solutions: Current methods for arrhythmia detection in medical settings largely rely on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, adapting these models to work in dynamic, high-risk environments like fighter jets has not been sufficiently explored.
Previous Research: Much of the research into ECG-based arrhythmia detection has focused on the medical domain and has been trained using data from patients at rest. Limited research has been done on detecting arrhythmias in physically demanding environments, which directly applies to this project.
Existing Methods and Techniques:
Feature Extraction: Several methods for ECG feature extraction are well established, including the use of time-domain features (like heart rate variability) and frequency-domain features (such as power spectral density).
Unsupervised Learning: As part of the evaluation of models on datasets with unknown arrhythmia labels, unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection could be applied.


Possible Limitations and Risks:
Data Availability: There is limited real-world data from F-35 pilots experiencing arrhythmias, which makes model validation difficult.
Sensor Variability: The different sensors used in ECG recording could introduce noise or variability, which could affect model accuracy.
