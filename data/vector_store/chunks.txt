Project Data & AI – Project 1 Client name: Inholland University of Applied Sciences, Robotics department Project name: Facial recognition and pain detection in Stroke patients with partial paralysis using deep learning About the client: The robotics department of Inholland University of Applied sciences focuses on a variety of application ranging from agricultural picking machines to healthcare robots. Within this department a group of researchers and students are working on ISHA, a robot designed to aid physical rehabilitation in stroke patients at home. About the project: The robot ISHA is designed to instruct stroke patients to perform arm exercises while seated. It is known that these exercises may lead to discomfort. In a setting with a physiotherapist, this can readily be detected. In a home setting with a care giver but without a physiotherapist, discomfort must be detect based on the patient’s facial expression. Emotion and pain detection using facial images is not a new problem. However, our target population differs considerably from the general population. This is expressed by a more generally depressed state, mostly elderly individuals, and paralysis of one side of the body and face. It is unclear if models trained on healthy individuals are sensitive enough to detect emotions and pain in this population. The main research questions are as follows: • Is it possible to perform facial recognition on images of stroke patients with partial paralysis? • What are the requirements and performance indicators of a model for detection of emotions and pain in stroke patients with partial facial paralysis? About the dataset: There is ample data available of emotions and pain in healthy individuals and certain patient groups. The data related to faces with partial paralysis in stroke is very limited. Initially, we will provide data of semi-paralyzed faces that can be compared to healthy faces for the first research question. As specific images of pain and discomfort are not readily available for our target population, we would like the project team to simulate the dataset based on datasets of healthy individuals and images of stroke patients. Available data: • Stroke patients vs. healthy (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danish003/face-images-of- acute-stroke-and-non-acute-stroke) • Pain recognition from facial expression database(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/coder98/emotionpain) • Emotion and identity detection from face images (https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial- keypoints-detector/data) • Pain e-motion database: Pain E-Motion Faces Database 279 images from 68 individuals • Multimodal pain database (https://vap.aau.dk/mintpain-database/) • BioVid heat pain database (https://www.nit.ovgu.de/BioVid.html) • Affective facial expression database (https://www.affectiva.com/facial-expression- dataset/)

The RIPE NCC supports the infrastructure of the Internet through technical coordination in our service region. Our most prominent activity is to act as the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) providing global Internet resources and related services (IPv4, IPv6 and AS Number resources) to members in our service region. More info at: www.ripe.net / https://www.ripe.net/about-us/what-we-do/ About the project: With RIPE Atlas we collect the latencies between measurement points on the Internet. In our RIPE Atlas anchors mesh, we do this between a few hundred servers world-wide. So for each pair of measurement points (we call them RIPE Atlas anchors) we have a time series of latencies. We would like to have an accurate prediction of the latency and latency variation in the upcoming 15 minutes between a pair of measurement points, based on the recent past (for instance the last 7 days’ worth of data, or the last 4 weeks). Our question: Is AI able to make better predictions on this data than traditional statistical methods, like Holt Winters forecasting. Ideally, the deliverable for this project is a code repo with python code that can answer these questions About the dataset: An example of the data is available here: This is what the data looks like for a few sources in Taiwan to a destination in the USA: https://atlas.ripe.net/api/v2/measurements/50894291/results/?start=1735732800&stop=17359 92000&probe_ids=6700,6995,6907,6818,7356,7230&format=json (each source has a different probe ID (prb_id), for different destinations you need a different destination ID).

We aim to achieve this by performing two core tasks (roles). The first is to support the Dutch government in carrying out statutory government tasks in the public interest. TNO’s second core task is to strengthen the earning power of the Dutch economy and increase employment. About the project: This project focuses on identifying unexplained physiological events (UPEs) experienced by F-35 pilots during high-stress, high-G maneuvers. Pilots sometimes report feeling unwell during these maneuvers, raising the critical question: is this due to a genuine physiological anomaly, or is it a false alarm? To address this, we aim to develop analytical modules that process ECG signals from sensors worn by the pilots. The primary goal is to design a robust arrhythmia classifier capable of detecting irregular heartbeats, such as premature or delayed heart contractions. However, the project faces a significant challenge: ensuring the classifier remains effective across different domains and sensor types. Given that the specific ECG sensor and measurement methods might vary in the future, the algorithm must generalize well to unseen signal sources. Furthermore, there exists no data of pilots becoming with many arrhythmic heart beats during flight (luckily), and therefore any classifier has to be trained on data from controlled experiments, but should work during flight. This is a second reason why generalization is important. Initial experiments suggest that traditional models such as Random Forests perform well on the dataset they are trained on but fail on new datasets with different characteristics. Conversely, Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) show better cross-domain robustness. You will work on improving domain transfer robustness through innovative methodological choices. About the dataset: To facilitate development, students will use a labeled ECG dataset available from PhysioNet (https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/), featuring arrhythmias recorded from individuals at rest. This supervised training phase provides a foundation for the classifier. The next step involves evaluating the model on a second dataset, where participants engage in different activities such as running or cycling—mimicking the high-variability conditions of fighter pilots. This second dataset may lack arrhythmia labels, requiring students to devise novel evaluation

The next step involves evaluating the model on a second dataset, where participants engage in different activities such as running or cycling—mimicking the high-variability conditions of fighter pilots. This second dataset may lack arrhythmia labels, requiring students to devise novel evaluation strategies, such as manual labeling or unsupervised approaches. We will select a fitting dataset together, there are multiple options on PhysioNet.

At KPN we are all passionate about offering secure, reliable and future- proof networks and services, enabling people to be connected anytime, anywhere, whilst at the same time creating a more prosperous and cleaner world. We have been doing this based on a strong vision, for almost 150 years. KPN is listed on the Euronext stock exchange. More on us: https://overons.kpn/ About the project: When bringing fiber connections to households, KPN uses 3rd-parties to install a Fiber Termination Unit (FTU) within the customer premises, very often in the proximity of the energy meter in the meter cupboard (meterkast). The positioning of the FTU is regulated by well-defined quality standards which the 3rd-party should meet. Unfortunately, such standards are not met in a relevant number of installations, generating fiber provisioning delays, customer unsatisfaction and additional costs. The main deliverable of this project is a computer vision model which is able to detect an (in)correctly installed FTU – i.e. according to the required quality standards - at the customer premises by processing a picture of such installation. A good performing model could then enable the development of a production grade application (out-of-scope) which will be used by the 3rd party field engineers to certify correct FTU installation to KPN. To further improve the business value of such project, we encourage the participation of multiple student groups, possibly building additional models (object detection, region proposal network, bounding box regression, spatial reasoning, etc.) able to suggest upfront the ideal location on where to install the FTU, by using a (synthetic) picture of a candidate spot of the customer premises. About the dataset: The training and validation datasets will jointly contain at least 1000 datapoints, i.e. pictures of FTU installations at customer premises, to be

to suggest upfront the ideal location on where to install the FTU, by using a (synthetic) picture of a candidate spot of the customer premises. About the dataset: The training and validation datasets will jointly contain at least 1000 datapoints, i.e. pictures of FTU installations at customer premises, to be labeled as (non-)compliant with the help of KPN Quality Assurance experts and conform the current installation quality criteria. An exploration dataset is already available and you will use it to select the useful images, i.e. those where it is clear whether at least one of the quality standard is (un)met, in order to precisely define how to take the pictures to be included in the training set and create a complete distribution of good/bad installations, based on all the quality criteria. A field trip is planned to experience the (non-)compliant FTU installations yourself, to ask the experts anything and even to help taking the pictures and gathering customer consent.

more tailored guidance. About the project: Due to escalating demands, the construction industry faces mounting pressure to integrate non- conventional materials. Traditional materials such as timber, masonry, fiber cement, and metal struggle to keep up with global population growth. They also cause adverse environmental impacts. One solution is to adopt circular construction practices focused on reducing waste, promoting recycling, and using sustainable materials — biodegradable glass, for example, or recycled tires. Another innovative alternative gaining traction involves using mycelium, the root structure of fungi, as a construction material for bricks and cladding. Mycelium-based materials are biodegradable, consume little energy, and have a low carbon footprint. The client has time-series data (unstructured) of mycelium growth acquired for 10-14 days. The objective is to deploy an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to analyze whether groups of images could be clustered together having similar features across time. If the clustering by the model captures features across the timeline, it will help to identify the development phases of the mycelium. About the dataset: The available dataset has multiple folders of mycelium growth images taken across the timestamp. The total number of images is more than 5000.

We focus on robotics in pome fruits (e.g., apples, pears), field vegetables (e.g., broccoli, strawberries, chicory), and – a bit of a Dutch pride - flower bulbs. About the project: Chicory, or Brussels chicory, is a leafy vegetable grown biennially. In spring, chicory is sown directly in the soil. The seeds grow into large green endive-like heads, with thick carrot-like brown- white "pens" developing underground. In autumn, these pens are harvested and (without leaves) brought to the chicory farm. There, they are kept in cold storage for up to a year. Periodically, new trays filled with pens are placed in a controlled environment and grown in water over a few weeks ("forcing chicory") until they develop into full white heads. Placing the pens in the trays is a very labor-intensive process. In this project, we're

Periodically, new trays filled with pens are placed in a controlled environment and grown in water over a few weeks ("forcing chicory") until they develop into full white heads. Placing the pens in the trays is a very labor-intensive process. In this project, we're exploring to what extent this process can be automated. As such, the pens need to be detected and segmented, and the top, bottom, and contact points need to be identified. About the dataset: The dataset consists of 1018 high-resolution images, with 78 images annotated using bounding boxes. The annotations include object dimensions such as length and width and labels for each object. The dataset captures objects like roots and stems in various orientations, shapes, and sizes, ensuring diversity. All images are of high quality, captured under controlled conditions for consistency.

About the dataset: The dataset consists of images extracted from GoPro video footage, captured at 30 frames per second to ensure sufficient detail and information. It contains approximately 5000 raw, unlabeled images. Since the dataset is unprocessed, it requires cleaning, preprocessing, and enhancement before it can be used for analysis or model training.

Project name: Detection of Tomato Head thickness Diameter from RGB-D Camera Images Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning Techniques in Greenhouse Conditions About the client: The Research and Innovation Centre Techniek, Ontwerpen & Informatica (RIC-TOI) of Inholland University of Applied Sciences contributes to a sustainable living environment and resilient society. Whether it's the increasing pressure on healthcare, the call for efficient and ecological food production or the challenges surrounding climate change: today's issues require solutions that are smart. Practically applicable, without creating new problems. Solutions, therefore, in which effective technological innovations play a key role. About the project: The world’s population is predicted to reach 9.1 billion by 2050, and this will require an increase of 70% in food availability, but so far 1 billion people are still suffering from hunger. It was estimated that 30% of the food produced for human consumption globally is lost or wasted somewhere along the food supply chain. Food loss and waste have significant negative food-security, economic and environmental impacts. Tackling food losses and waste in an efficient, sustainable, and integrated way should be considered an urgent thing to feed people and optimize the use of natural and financial resources at the same time. For growers, head thickness is a crucial indicator of tomato plant health, with an ideal target measurement of approximately 10mm. A thickness below this target suggests weak plant growth, making the plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases. On the other hand, if the thickness exceeds this threshold, it indicates that the plant is diverting excess sugars to its leaves instead of focusing on flower and fruit development. Accurately detecting and managing head thickness is therefore essential for optimizing plant health

plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases. On the other hand, if the thickness exceeds this threshold, it indicates that the plant is diverting excess sugars to its leaves instead of focusing on flower and fruit development. Accurately detecting and managing head thickness is therefore essential for optimizing plant health and yield in greenhouse conditions. The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a system that accurately detects and measures the head thickness diameter of tomatoes in a greenhouse environment. This system will utilize RGB-D cameras to capture depth information, and leverage Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision techniques to process the data and perform the measurements. 1. How can RGB-D camera images be utilized to accurately measure the head thickness diameter of tomatoes in greenhouse condi5ons? What preprocessing steps are necessary to enhance the quality of RGB-D data for tomato measurement? 2. Which computer vision techniques are most effective for segmenting and detecting tomato heads in RGB-D images under varying greenhouse conditions? e.g 3D-Cloud? YOLO v9,10,11 How do lighting conditions, occlusions, and plant positioning affect the segmentation accuracy? 3. What deep learning models perform best for es5ma5ng tomato head thickness diameter from RGB-D images? How do different neural network architectures (e.g., CNNs, U-Net) compare in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency? 4. How does the inclusion of depth informa5on from RGB-D cameras improve the accuracy of tomato head thickness measurements compared to using RGB images alone? What role does depth data play in distinguishing tomato head features that are critical for diameter estimation? 5. What are the challenges of implementing this detection system in real-time greenhouse environments, and how can they be addressed? How robust is the system against common greenhouse variables such as fluctuating light conditions, temperature changes, and varying plant growth stages? 6. What are the poten5al benefits and limita5ons of using deep learning and computer vision for agricultural applica5ons, specifically for measuring tomato head thickness in greenhouse conditions? What impact does this approach have on labor efficiency, accuracy of crop monitoring, and overall greenhouse management? About the dataset: Images data set.

Amora Amir Amora.amir@inholland.nl Project Data and AI – Project 10 Client name: Incision Project name: Comparing and optimizing materials needed for surgical procedure About the client: Incision is a company that was founded 10 years ago by Theo Wiggers, a surgeon. Incision started as an e-learning company for surgical professionals. Nowadays Incision supports operating room (OR) workflows using an app named Assist. This app contains all relevant information needed for a surgical team to be well prepared for a procedure in the OR: It contains information for setting of the OR, the devices, the preparation of the patient, the materials needed and the steps of the procedure, including the preferences of each surgeon in that specific hospital. About the project: Ideally surgeons use the same materials (instruments and disposables) for their procedures, but there is a variety in what they use: This lack of standardization may lead to delays (team does not have the right materials), mistakes (team gives the wrong material) and costs (using materials that are more expensive than needed). During this project you identify the variety in materials used and come up with a dashboard for the OR manager to show the room for improvement and can give an advice how to standardize their practice About the dataset: When we look at 1 hospital we do have about 600 procedures, each procedure containing between 5 or 10 surgeons performing this procedure, so 3000-6000 lists of materials. For each procedure a surgeon would need between 20 and 40 materials. Of these materials 90% will be similar for each surgeon, but the interesting part is in the varying 10% Contact details: Marian Scheer Scheer@incision.care 06-44557296 Project Data and AI – Project 11 Client name: Moodies Undies Project name: Life cycle value x Moodies Undies About the client: Moodies undies is a Dutch, Amsterdam-based scale-up.

chemicals in these products that are not at all good for your body's health. In addition, for young girls it is not at all nice and easy to use. There is also still a taboo on menstruation and many women and girls know little about their own body. There is also still enough menstrual poverty in the Netherlands. This is why moodies is committed to offering a comfortable, stylish and sustainable alternative. In this way we try to reconnect women with their cycle and make them aware that menstruation is part of your overall health. Our dream is to substantially reduce menstrual waste. Moodies pants can make a significant contribution to this. We will all have to work together towards a cleaner planet for our children in which we make more sustainable choices to leave the planet healthier for our children. And we are really happy that we can offer many women and girls a great solution. For girls and ladies with a heavier menstruation, for girls who have their first period and for ladies who experience mild incontinence. About the project: The main problem we want to have solved is the minimal understanding of our customers. We know who they are and what they like but we want to study their behavior. We want to know that when they order from us, when they will order again. But also, where did they come from, direct, search, social media. In the end the conclusion of the project will tell us which fields we need to focus on and when we can retarget the people that recently bought something in our store. About the dataset: Our store is built in Shopify. The back end tracks data from customers and tells you if they have bought before. We can export data that shows first the customers vs returning customers, separate documents of returning customers and first time customers that didn’t return (so far;)) and we can export all the orders. When we export we can deliver a CSV document.

MEDxAI specializes in data science challenges in healthcare. The amount of healthcare data is growing to staggering amounts and the potential of exploiting this data to improve healthcare is widely recognized. However, it remains difficult to harness this potential for the benefit of patients and the amount of data driven diagnostic support systems a doctor and patient can use in the clinical practice remains limited to this day. Our mission is to bring data science into the doctor's office and to assist the doctor in giving the best possible care to the patient. About the project: For the development of a clinical decision support system we extract model features from electronic health records from a hospital. The data contained in the electronic health records span multiple data modalities, ranging from structured tabular data like laboratory measurements to unstructured timeseries data such as ECG data and free text data. Each modality requires a bespoke extraction approach. Specifically for processing radiology reports we want to estimate the probability that a radiology report is associated with certain medical conditions. This is challenging because the Dutch clinical language is under-resourced in terms of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tooling and hence this assignment may lead to a significant contribution to this field. You are tasked with: • preparing the data • model selection • model training • deployment via a REST server • and writing clean/reproducible code About the dataset: We will have a semi-public research dataset containing annotated translated English radiology reports, with, in the order of hundreds of thousands of documents.

deaths due to cardiovascular diseases happen outside the hospital. The main goal is helping patients to reduce hospital visits. The solution we found is developed in a pocket size ECG monitor which can be connected to the HeartEye app. This recorder simplifies the measurement procedure to a level that is workable for everyone, so patients can acquire their own ECG. The second step is to automate the interpretation using AI so that not only doctors but patients as well can monitor their heart rhythm anywhere and anytime. About the project: There is a large ECG dataset available made with traditional ECG recorders (that differs slightly from our recordings). This is the main dataset. Second, a novel ECG recorder has been developed and a prototype is available. With this recorder you create the second (small) dataset. During this project you will use the large public data set and pre-train a model that can diagnose ECGs. Second, you will finetune that model on the small dataset, made with the Hearteye ECG recorder.

AI die onze golfbaan slimmer maakt. About the client: Wij zijn de Heemskerkse Golfclub, een actieve en gastvrije golfvereniging met een prachtige 18- holes baan en een uitdagende Par3-baan. Met een levendig ledenbestand, gastspelers en regelmatige wedstrijden en evenementen, zijn wij dagelijks bezig om een optimale ervaring te bieden aan iedereen die van golf houdt. Om onze banen efficiënt te beheren en onze leden en gasten goed van dienst te zijn, maken wij gebruik van het reserveringssysteem Egolf4U. Dit systeem bevat alle gegevens over ons ledenbestand en wordt gebruikt voor het plannen van starttijden, zowel voor leden als gastspelers, maar ook voor wedstrijden en evenementen. About the project: Hoewel Egolf4U ons voorziet van waardevolle gegevens, halen we deze op dit moment handmatig uit het systeem. Een administratrice verzamelt de benodigde informatie en presenteert dit in spreadsheets. Dit proces is tijdsintensief, beperkt de snelheid van onze besluitvorming en maakt het lastig om trends en patronen in de baanbezetting te herkennen. We willen een volgende stap zetten door onze data beter te benutten en te koppelen aan externe data zoals bijvoorbeeld het KNMI. Historische gegevens over reserveringen bevatten potentieel waardevolle inzichten die ons kunnen helpen om: * Voorspellingen te doen over de baanbezetting, bijvoorbeeld met behulp van AI-modellen. * Betere beslissingen te nemen over marketingactiviteiten, zoals het aantrekken van gastspelers of het promoten van rustige periodes. * Informatie toegankelijker te maken, bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van interactieve dashboards, zodat we snel en eenvoudig overzicht hebben. About the dataset: In Excel (.xls/.csv). Hoeveel data is ons niet bekend. De data betreft o.m. speeltijden, speelfrequenties, no-shows, persoonsinfo e.m.

SAIL was first organized 50 years ago by the Port of Amsterdam as a celebration of the city’s 700th anniversary. Due to its immense success, it was decided to repeat the event every five years. Over the years, SAIL has grown into the largest free-access event in the Netherlands. Since 1980, the Foundation SAIL Amsterdam has successfully organized all editions every five years. Well, almost all. As you may know, the 2020 edition was unfortunately canceled due to Covid. Fortunately, preparations for 2025 are already in full swing. The organization

grown into the largest free-access event in the Netherlands. Since 1980, the Foundation SAIL Amsterdam has successfully organized all editions every five years. Well, almost all. As you may know, the 2020 edition was unfortunately canceled due to Covid. Fortunately, preparations for 2025 are already in full swing. The organization aims to make SAIL Amsterdam the most impactful event ever; after all, 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of SAIL and the 750th anniversary of Amsterdam. Want to get an idea of how grand and special SAIL is? Check out the after movie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9zEvgR6_F0) of SAIL Amsterdam 2015. About the project: The sales of hospitality packages are an important source of revenue for the SAIL event. In the past this was done by an external company, but in 2013 the SAIL organization decided to take this task upon itself for the edition of 2015. Prediction of sales of these packages are important for budget predictions, but also difficult, due to the fact that the event only takes place every 5 years and the world and also systems that can be worked with change considerably in the meantime. After SAIL Amsterdam 2015 sales predictions were made for the edition of 2020. However, the system used in 2015 only recorded actual sales, not the quotation. Also the numbers had to be normalized for various ‘incidents’ like taking over bookings from another booking agency. As mentioned before SAIL Amsterdam 2020 could unfortunately not take place due to Covid and although packages were sold before that, the sales numbers were only reliable up until January 2024 to make predictions for the edition of 2025. Next to that, the organization has a feeling that that booking patterns might have changed: large groups for example have other booking characteristics than other segments, smaller groups tend to book later, but probably more than in previous years. At this moment SAIL is working hard on selling as many packages as possible for the event in August 2025. Next to that the hospitality department is already looking forward to 2030. How can the sales & revenue of SAIL Amsterdam 2030 be predicted? Therefore we would like you to analyze the current and previous sales revenue numbers to make a sales revenue prediction model for SAIL Amsterdam 2030. About the dataset: We have sales data from 2015. For the years 2020 and 2025, we have data from the moment of request

About the dataset: We have sales data from 2015. For the years 2020 and 2025, we have data from the moment of request to booking. This means we have conversion rates and can better estimate how many requests for quotations are needed at different times. We have approximately 3000 sales opportunities (requests for quotations) and 1500 bookings. Most of these are business-related, so the dataset can be enriched with characteristics of these companies (sector, size, number of branches, etc.) Contact details: Jasper Stikkelorum jasper@sail.nl 06-14062224

Introduction This action plan outlines the research assignment undertaken by Project Group 3, which consists of the following students: Bianca Burlacu, Wojciech Kolasa, Codrin Calin and Salman Kanj. Project Group 3 is working on Classifying Arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots for TNO. F-35 pilots sometimes experience unexplained physiological events (UPEs) during high-G maneuvers, raising concerns about potential physiological anomalies. Accurately distinguishing between genuine arrhythmic events and false alarms is critical for pilot safety and operational effectiveness. To address this, TNO seeks to develop an advanced ECG-based arrhythmia classifier. This project focuses on improving the reliability of an arrhythmia classification system designed to detect irregular heartbeats in pilots. A key challenge is ensuring the classifier performs well across different domains and sensor types, as ECG measurement conditions may vary. The goal is to enhance the classifier’s ability to generalize across datasets, ensuring reliable performance even when trained on controlled experiments but applied in real flight conditions. This will be achieved by exploring innovative machine learning approaches that improve domain transfer adaptability. This document follows a structured approach to outline the research assignment, its background, methodology, and expected outcomes. The introduction presents the purpose of the project and its significance. The second chapter provides details on the assignment itself, including the problem statement and its broader context.

Assignment and background This section provides an overview of the research assignment, including the problem it seeks to address and its broader context. The objective is to gain insight into the significance of the project and the environment in which it is conducted. The section outlines the assignment issued by the client, as well as the sector, company, and department relevant to the research. 2.1. The assignment issued The assignment, issued by TNO (Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research), focuses on classifying arrhythmia in F-35 fighter pilots. Pilots sometimes experience unexplained physiological events (UPEs) during high-G maneuvers, raising concerns about potential physiological anomalies. The goal of this research is to develop an advanced ECG-based arrhythmia classifier that can reliably distinguish between actual arrhythmias and false alarms. The primary challenge is ensuring that the classifier is reliable enough to perform well across different sensor types and measurement conditions. Given that there is limited real-world flight data involving arrhythmic events, the classifier must be trained on controlled experimental data while maintaining high accuracy when applied in real flight conditions. Initial research has shown that traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forests, fail to generalize effectively to new datasets, whereas Support Vector Classifiers (SVCs) show better cross-domain adaptability. This project aims to enhance the classifier’s domain transfer stability through innovative machine learning techniques. 2.2. Context of the assignment Sector This research falls within the defense and aerospace sector, specifically focusing on physiological monitoring and aviation safety. Fighter pilots are subjected to extreme physical conditions, particularly during high-G maneuvers, where physiological stress can lead to performance degradation or medical incidents. Ensuring pilot safety is a priority for defense organizations worldwide, making real-time health monitoring a crucial area of research. A key challenge in this sector is the reliability of physiological monitoring systems. Current ECG-based classifiers often struggle with cross-domain performance due to variations in sensor

performance degradation or medical incidents. Ensuring pilot safety is a priority for defense organizations worldwide, making real-time health monitoring a crucial area of research. A key challenge in this sector is the reliability of physiological monitoring systems. Current ECG-based classifiers often struggle with cross-domain performance due to variations in sensor types, signal noise, and environmental conditions. The ability to create a stable and adaptable classifier will contribute to improved in-flight health monitoring and potentially set new standards for pilot safety protocols. Company: TNO TNO is an independent research organization in the Netherlands dedicated to applied scientific research. It collaborates with government bodies, private enterprises, and academic institutions to drive innovation in fields such as defense, energy, health, and ICT.

It provides technological solutions that support the Dutch military, including research on human performance in extreme environments. Within this context, the arrhythmia classification project aligns with TNO’s broader goal of enhancing safety and operational effectiveness in high-risk scenarios. Department The research is conducted within TNO’s Human Performance and Biomedical Monitoring division. This department focuses on understanding physiological responses to extreme conditions and developing technologies to optimize human performance. Key activities include: Developing physiological monitoring systems for military and aerospace applications Conducting biomedical research on human adaptation to stress and fatigue Designing AI-driven solutions for real-time health monitoring The research team consists of data scientists, biomedical engineers, and defense specialists working together to enhance the resilience of physiological monitoring technologies. This project contributes to ongoing efforts in optimizing ECG signal processing and improving the practical deployment of machine learning models in operational environments. 3.

into the challenge. 3.1. Analysis of the Assignment The task at hand involves developing an arrhythmia classifier capable of detecting irregular heartbeats in F-35 pilots during high-stress, high-G manoeuvres. The pilots sometimes report feeling unwell during these manoeuvres, and it is crucial to determine whether this is due to genuine physiological anomalies or is a false alarm caused by sensor or environmental factors. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the classifier must generalize well to different sensors and sensor types, which may change in the future, making it necessary for the algorithm to perform effectively across different datasets. Problem Description: The main problem is the inability of current machine learning models to generalize across different domains, sensor types, and activity conditions. The classifier must be able to detect arrhythmic events reliably from ECG data, which is recorded in varying conditions (resting, running, or high-stress flight situations). A significant hurdle is that real-world flight data showing arrhythmias does not exist, so the classifier must be trained and validated using controlled datasets, which may differ from actual flight conditions. Ensuring the classifier’s reliability when moving between different data sources is crucial. Stakeholders: F-35 Pilots: They are the most directly affected group. Their safety is the highest priority, as a misdiagnosed arrhythmia could jeopardize their health and mission success. Dutch Government: Through TNO, the Dutch government has a vested interest in ensuring the safety and performance of its armed forces. TNO: The organization responsible for addressing this issue through the development of a reliable arrhythmia detection system that can be integrated into the cockpit systems of fighter jets. ECG Sensor Manufacturers: These companies provide the technology used to collect the physiological data needed for classification, and their devices must be reliable enough to handle the extreme conditions of high-G maneuvers. Medical Professionals and Flight Medics: They must accurately interpret the data, ensuring that pilots receive appropriate medical attention if a genuine arrhythmic event occurs. The Client: The client for this project is TNO, who has commissioned the research to develop an arrhythmia classifier that can be used for F-35 pilots. They are looking for solutions that can be implemented in a real-world context, ensuring pilots' safety and maximizing the generalizability of the model. Other Affected Groups: Aircraft manufacturers: Manufacturers of the F-35 jet and the cockpit systems will be indirectly affected as they may need to integrate the arrhythmia detection system

are looking for solutions that can be implemented in a real-world context, ensuring pilots' safety and maximizing the generalizability of the model. Other Affected Groups: Aircraft manufacturers: Manufacturers of the F-35 jet and the cockpit systems will be indirectly affected as they may need to integrate the arrhythmia detection system into the aircraft's operational systems. Air Force Operations: The operational procedures and health monitoring protocols used during flight may need to adapt if new detection systems are implemented. Who Will Benefit: Pilots: They will benefit directly from the improved safety and health monitoring, potentially preventing health incidents during flight. TNO: Successfully addressing this challenge would reinforce TNO's reputation as a leader in developing innovative and impactful solutions for the defense sector. Dutch Defense Forces: The safety of pilots during missions will be improved, contributing to the overall effectiveness and safety of the military operations. ECG Sensor Manufacturers: The demand for more stable and adaptable ECG sensors would rise, prompting innovation in the sensor technology. Who Might Be Negatively Affected: Overly Cautious Monitoring Systems: If the classifier is too sensitive, it may lead to false alarms, causing unnecessary panic, interruptions, or even causing pilots to abandon critical missions due to erroneous readings. A poorly optimized system could negatively affect performance in the cockpit. Manufacturers of Older or Less Reliable ECG Sensors: Manufacturers whose devices do not meet the evolving demands of high-stress environments might lose out on opportunities for integration into defense systems. When the Problem Arose: The problem has existed as long as fighter pilots have been subject to high-stress, high-G environments. The specific focus on ECG-based arrhythmia detection has become more critical with the increasing complexity and performance demands placed on pilots. The need for real-time health monitoring is amplified as the aircraft systems grow more sophisticated and as pilot safety becomes a top priority in military operations. What Prompted the Problem: The problem arose from reports by F-35 pilots who sometimes experience unexplained physiological events during high-stress maneuvers. These experiences raised concerns about the pilots' safety and led to the need for a reliable system to monitor heart health during such critical operations. Why It’s a Problem: This problem is critical because any misdiagnosis could lead to serious health risks for the pilots and potential loss of life. Moreover, if the arrhythmia classifier fails to perform reliably across various scenarios, it might undermine confidence in using ECG-based health

health during such critical operations. Why It’s a Problem: This problem is critical because any misdiagnosis could lead to serious health risks for the pilots and potential loss of life. Moreover, if the arrhythmia classifier fails to perform reliably across various scenarios, it might undermine confidence in using ECG-based health monitoring systems in future missions. Where the Problem Occurs: This problem occurs primarily during high-G maneuvers in F-35 jets, where pilots are subjected to intense physical stress. The data used for training and validating the classifier must come from controlled conditions (e.g., resting or activity-based ECG data) but needs to generalize well to real-world flight conditions, which have higher variability. Tools to Sharpen the Problem: Fishbone Diagram: A fishbone diagram can help identify potential causes of the problem, including factors like sensor quality, environmental conditions, pilot stress levels, and data quality. This will give insights into the root causes that affect model performance. 5xWhy: The 5xWhy technique will help drill down to the core issues by repeatedly asking “why” to understand why current models do not generalize well, why pilot health monitoring is critical, and why current solutions are insufficient. 3.2. Theoretical Exploration: Source Research To deepen our understanding of the problem, a comprehensive literature review is essential. The theoretical exploration will look at relevant existing research, explore possible methodologies for developing the classifier, and examine previous studies and current technological trends in arrhythmia detection. Action Plan for Finding Sources: Exploring Similar Problems: There are several studies that have explored arrhythmia detection from ECG signals. Many of these focus on detecting arrhythmias in resting or semi-active states, but very few focus on high-stress or high-G environments, which is a key gap. Use of PhysioNet: The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database on PhysioNet offers an excellent starting point for developing a classifier in a controlled environment. From there, we can explore research on transferring models to new environments, like exercise or flight scenarios. Searching for Key Sources: We will search for articles, books, and white papers on: Arrhythmia detection techniques in medical diagnostics. The use of machine learning and signal processing in ECG classification. Techniques for improving cross-domain generalization in machine learning. Studies on the effects of high-G forces on human health, particularly on cardiac function. Important Concepts and Insights: ECG Signal Processing: Filtering, feature extraction, and noise reduction are key aspects that can significantly improve classification performance. Machine Learning Techniques: SVMs, Random

classification. Techniques for improving cross-domain generalization in machine learning. Studies on the effects of high-G forces on human health, particularly on cardiac function. Important Concepts and Insights: ECG Signal Processing: Filtering, feature extraction, and noise reduction are key aspects that can significantly improve classification performance. Machine Learning Techniques: SVMs, Random Forests, and newer deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for arrhythmia detection. However, techniques for ensuring generalization across sensor types, noise conditions, and environments are under-researched. Domain Transfer in Machine Learning: Techniques like transfer learning and domain adaptation are important when applying models trained on controlled data to real-world flight conditions. Current Trends in Pilot Health Monitoring: As aviation technology advances, so does the need for more reliable and unobtrusive health monitoring systems for pilots, which is driving research into real-time monitoring solutions. Previous Research and Existing Solutions: Existing Solutions: Current methods for arrhythmia detection in medical settings largely rely on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, adapting these models to work in dynamic, high-risk environments like fighter jets has not been sufficiently explored. Previous Research: Much of the research into ECG-based arrhythmia detection has focused on the medical domain and has been trained using data from patients at rest. Limited research has been done on detecting arrhythmias in physically demanding environments, which directly applies to this project. Existing Methods and Techniques: Feature Extraction: Several methods for ECG feature extraction are well established, including the use of time-domain features (like heart rate variability) and frequency-domain features (such as power spectral density). Unsupervised Learning: As part of the evaluation of models on datasets with unknown arrhythmia labels, unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection could be applied. Possible Limitations and Risks: Data Availability: There is limited real-world data from F-35 pilots experiencing arrhythmias, which makes model validation difficult. Sensor Variability: The different sensors used in ECG recording could introduce noise or variability, which could affect model accuracy. 4.

The access to the model via interface does not work at all, or there are major flaws. (e.g. no error handling at all, application keeps crashing, only running on localhost) There is no documentation or version control at all (for either code or model) There are major logical flaws in the report Example: What is the Bare Minimum Application? (passing grade: 5.5) A Flask app exposes a model via a single HTTP endpoint, providing predictions based on inputs. Error handling is existent but could be more specific or is partially incorrect, e.g. providing 500 as an error sometimes for invalid requests. The logs are visible via automatic Flask logging and displayed in the console. (e.g. Azure container app) There is basic version control of the code and multiple versions of the model available. However, there is significant room for improvement, and it is not a sustainable solution, the absolute minimum would be something like model_weights_v1.h5, model_weights_v2.h5, and a git repo with more than the initial commit. The report lists the steps towards deploying a new version, but they contain a larger number of manual steps and a larger effort to replicate. Example: What is a Great Application? (best grade: 10) This application provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable deployment of a resume-screening model via a well-structured API, accessible through secure HTTP endpoints. The system is deployed via Azure Web aPP, with automated CI/CD pipelines and integrated logging and monitoring. 1. Deployment Implementation Interface: The model is served through a REST API that provides both /predict, /health, and /metadata. Each endpoint has clear schema validation (e.g. using pydantic) and returns structured error responses (e.g., 422 for invalid input, 500 only for internal errors). Robustness: Implements exception handling with meaningful status codes and logging. Includes uptime monitoring via Azure and automated health checks. Performance & Scalability: Deployed within a scalable solution, build-time and latency are reduced by design choices - e.g. storing pre-computed data in storage solution and loading during building. 2.

1. Introduction This project investigates unexplained physiological events (UPEs) that F‑35 pilots occasionally experience during high-stress, high-G manoeuvres. These events, which might feel like arrhythmic heartbeats or other physiological anomalies, raise the question of whether they stem from genuine cardiac irregularities or false alarms. Our goal is to develop an arrhythmia classifier that can reliably flag potentially dangerous heart rhythms in real time, even when data is recorded from different sensor types or under varied conditions. Because there is limited real-world data showing pilots with confirmed arrhythmic episodes in flight, we train and test our methods primarily on standard datasets collected in controlled environments. Ensuring the classifier can adapt to new domains—such as different ECG sensors or novel flight conditions—remains essential. Previous experiments found that while certain traditional algorithms (like Random Forests) can excel on the dataset they are trained on, they often fail to generalize. This report describes our data cleaning process, which serves as the foundation for developing a well-generalized arrhythmia detection model. By filtering noise, normalizing signals, and ensuring data integrity, we aim to produce a dataset that best captures essential heartbeat characteristics, thereby increasing our model’s reliability across diverse real-world scenarios. 2. Dataset Analysis Dataset Content and Collection Method: Our team analysed the dataset (preprocessed_ecg.csv), which contains 2272 ECG records. Each record comprises 216 numerical features and one categorical label specifying the ECG beat type: Normal ('N'), Arrhythmia class 'A', and Arrhythmia class 'V'. Each feature represents ECG waveform amplitude at a specific timestamp and has been normalized for consistency. The dataset originates from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, a reputable source of clinically validated ECG recordings annotated by medical experts, chosen by our team and client for its reliability and wide acceptance in the medical community. The ECG signals in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database were recorded using standard Holter monitors. The data was collected from inpatients at Boston’s Beth Israel Hospital between 1975 and 1979. Each patient was monitored continuously, and heartbeat annotations were manually reviewed and corrected by medical experts. The data was digitized and stored in a structured format for further analysis. Data Format The dataset consists of: Signal files (.dat): Contain raw ECG waveform data, stored as binary files. Annotation files (.atr): Contain labels indicating heartbeat classes and rhythm events, provided as text-based numerical markers. Header files (.hea): Provide metadata about each recording, including patient ID, sampling frequency, gain factors, and lead information.

The dataset consists of: Signal files (.dat): Contain raw ECG waveform data, stored as binary files. Annotation files (.atr): Contain labels indicating heartbeat classes and rhythm events, provided as text-based numerical markers. Header files (.hea): Provide metadata about each recording, including patient ID, sampling frequency, gain factors, and lead information. Features and Classes The dataset includes a variety of heartbeat types, each labelled according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards. The main heartbeat classes include: Normal (N): Regular heartbeats. Supraventricular ectopic beats (S): Abnormal beats originating above the ventricles. Ventricular ectopic beats (V): Premature beats originating from the ventricles. Fusion beats (F): Combined normal and ventricular beats. Unknown beats (Q): Beats that do not fall into predefined categories. Annotations also include additional markers for rhythm changes, signal quality indicators, and other relevant cardiac events, such as: Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) Atrial flutter (AFL) Ventricular tachycardia (VT) Paced beats (P) Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis: Our comprehensive analysis yielded the following insights: Number of Records: 2272 Number of Features: 216 numerical amplitude measurements per record Feature Types: 216 numeric (float64), 1 categorical ('label') Range of Values: ECG amplitudes range approximately from -0.27 to 1.24. Classes and Annotation: Normal ('N'): 2238 samples (~98.5%) Arrhythmia ('A'): 33 samples (~1.45%) Arrhythmia ('V'): 1 sample (<0.1%) Our analysis highlighted substantial class imbalance, which we identified as a critical factor impacting subsequent modelling. 3. Dataset Visualization Our team performed detailed visual analyses, including: Class Distribution Plot: Clearly illustrates the significant class imbalance, emphasizing the dominance of normal beats ('N') compared to arrhythmia beats ('A', 'V'). Figure 1 Figure 1 highlights the substantial imbalance within our ECG dataset, with the class "N" (Normal) clearly dominating at approximately 98.5% of the total samples. In contrast, arrhythmia classes "A" and particularly "V" are significantly underrepresented. This imbalance poses potential challenges for training accurate and unbiased predictive models, making data balancing techniques highly recommended. ECG Waveform Samples: We visualized sample waveforms from each class, highlighting typical shapes and characteristics. Figure 2 Figure 2 demonstrates distinctive characteristics associated with ventricular arrhythmias. The waveform displays irregular signal amplitudes and atypical morphological features compared to normal ECG patterns. Recognizing these specific anomalies visually assists our team in accurately identifying and handling such outliers during modeling and preprocessing stages. Since our dataset is designed to classify arrhythmia vs. no arrhythmia, calculating the median or mean ECG values is not particularly meaningful.

atypical morphological features compared to normal ECG patterns. Recognizing these specific anomalies visually assists our team in accurately identifying and handling such outliers during modeling and preprocessing stages. Since our dataset is designed to classify arrhythmia vs. no arrhythmia, calculating the median or mean ECG values is not particularly meaningful. Unlike continuous numerical datasets where central tendency metrics provide insights into data distribution, ECG signals are inherently categorical in their classification (normal vs. arrhythmic beats). Additionally, identifying outliers is out of scope for this analysis, as our focus is not on analysing rare arrhythmias but rather on ensuring the dataset effectively distinguishes between normal and arrhythmic beats. 4. Cleaning of Dataset Noise Reduction (Bandpass Filtering) The ECG signals were passed through a bandpass filter (0.5–40 Hz) to remove low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise. This ensures the core heartbeat frequencies are preserved while eliminating much of the irrelevant “static” or artifact in the signal. Normalization: After filtering, the code normalizes each signal by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This step brings all heartbeats onto a consistent scale, making later analysis or model training more reliable. Segmentation and Automatic Skipping of Incomplete Windows: The code extracts a portion of the signal around each R-peak (200 ms before to 400 ms after). Only segments fully within the recording are kept. No manual datapoint removal or outlier removal was performed beyond skipping segments that would exceed the recording boundaries. Data Augmentation Considerations Given the severe class imbalance in our dataset (98.5% normal beats vs. 1.45% arrhythmia class A and <0.1% class V), data augmentation could be a useful technique to improve model performance. However, augmentation techniques such as SMOTE or synthetic ECG generation were not applied in this stage. Potential augmentation strategies include: Synthetic ECG data generation using generative models like GANs or variational autoencoders to create realistic arrhythmic beats. Time-warping or jittering of existing arrhythmia samples to create variations in the dataset. Oversampling minority classes to ensure a more balanced distribution during training. Since our focus in this stage was on cleaning the raw ECG signals, augmentation was not included in this pipeline but remains an important step for improving classification accuracy. Future iterations could incorporate augmentation techniques to address the imbalance issue and ensure better model generalization.

TNO classifying arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots GROUP 3 Bianca Burlacu Codrin Calin Salman Kanj Wojciech Kolasa Table of contents Project introduction Technologies Used Demo Conclusion Project introduction Project Goal: Develop a robust arrhythmia classifier to detect irregular heartbeats in F-35 pilots using ECG data. Challenge: Ensure the model generalizes across different sensor types and flight conditions, despite limited in-flight arrhythmia data. Approach: Focus on domain-transfer techniques to improve robustness. Initial results show SVCs outperform traditional models like Random Forests in cross-domain performance. Datasets Used Train Set Distribution Train Set Counts Data augmentation & Balancing Data augmentation is a technique that increase the size of a training dataset by applying various transformations to existing data samples. The purpose of data augmentation is to introduce diversity and variability into the training data, which can help improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models. The distribution of our data between different categories is not balanced. Therefore our model will train with unbalanced data and find bias and will be overfit. Balancing the dataset is crucial for building robust and unbiased machine learning models that can effectively generalize to unseen data and provide fair and accurate predictions across all classes. After Balancing After Balancing CNN + LSTM Model The model consists of three CNN layers, each with 64 filters and a kernel size of 6 for the first layer, and 3 for the second and third layers. ReLU activation functions are applied after each convolutional layer. Additionally, batch normalization layers are included after each Conv1D layer to normalize the activations. MaxPooling layers follow each Conv1D layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. Following the CNN layers, two LSTM layers are added. The first LSTM layer contains 64 units and returns sequences. It utilizes the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function. The second LSTM layer comprises 32 units and also uses the tanh activation function. LSTM layers are commonly employed for processing sequential data such as time series or text. After the LSTM layers, a Flatten layer is introduced. This layer transforms the output of the LSTM layers into a 1D tensor, which is suitable for input to the Dense layers. Finally, three Dense (fully connected) layers are appended to the model. The first Dense layer contains 64 units, and the second Dense layer contains 32 units, with ReLU activation applied to both layers. The output Dense layer consists of 5 units

final report Classifying Arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots June 6, 2025 Group 3 Table of contents Introduction Fighter pilots, particularly those operating F-35 aircraft, are often subjected to extreme physical and cognitive stress during high-G maneuvers. These conditions occasionally lead to Unexplained Physiological Events (UPEs), which can manifest as symptoms resembling cardiac arrhythmias. The primary aim of this project is to investigate whether these symptoms stem from genuine arrhythmic events or are merely false alarms induced by environmental or physiological stressors. To address this, our project developed a proof-of-concept arrhythmia classification system using electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The classifier was trained on publicly available, medically annotated ECG datasets under controlled conditions and designed to generalize to operational settings involving sensor variability and high physical stress. Our hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks aims to capture both morphological and temporal features of ECG signals, which are critical in distinguishing normal from abnormal heartbeats. The results of our classifier not only provide insight into the viability of real-time arrhythmia monitoring in extreme conditions but also inform further development of integrated health monitoring systems in military aviation. 1.Literature review This section synthesizes existing research on ECG-based arrhythmia detection and its applicability in high-stress environments such as military aviation. 1.1 AI in Arrhythmia Detection Research has shown that deep learning models, particularly CNNs and hybrid architectures, outperform traditional algorithms like Random Forests and Support Vector Machines in arrhythmia classification tasks. For instance, studies like the one implementing the VA-ResNet-50 architecture demonstrated ~76% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.79 using ambulatory ECG data, showcasing the potential of AI in real-world health monitoring (Barker et al., 2024). A broader systematic review identified CNNs and hybrid models as particularly effective in detecting complex arrhythmias, provided they are trained on large, diverse datasets. These models are favored for their ability to learn features directly from raw ECG signals, reducing reliance on handcrafted features (Denysyuk et al., 2023; Rahul & Sharma, 2025). 1.2 Domain Adaptation and Generalization A core challenge in ECG classification is ensuring that models trained on controlled datasets generalize well to new environments. The MACN model using unsupervised domain adaptation showed promising results in transferring learned features to unseen datasets without labeled data (Chen et al., 2020). Such methods are highly relevant for military use, where labeled in-flight data is scarce. 1.3 Physiological Monitoring in Military Aviation Integrating real-time

well to new environments. The MACN model using unsupervised domain adaptation showed promising results in transferring learned features to unseen datasets without labeled data (Chen et al., 2020). Such methods are highly relevant for military use, where labeled in-flight data is scarce. 1.3 Physiological Monitoring in Military Aviation Integrating real-time physiological monitoring in aviation is crucial for enhancing pilot safety. Reviews highlight opportunities for wearable ECG systems and their integration with pilot gear. However, they also stress challenges such as sensor reliability and data interpretation under high-G conditions (Shaw & Harrell, 2023). Studies also emphasize the impact of high-G forces on cardiac function, noting structural changes and increased arrhythmic risk. These insights are critical in designing classifiers that remain robust across varied physical conditions (Soh et al., 2024; Chung & Lee, 2001). 1.4 Zero-shot and Personalized Models A novel approach involves zero-shot learning, enabling models to detect arrhythmias in individuals with no prior abnormal ECG records. One system achieved over 98% accuracy and 92.8% F1-score, operating on low-power wearable devices, a configuration particularly suitable for pilot use (Daydulo et al., 2023). 2.Research questions 2.1 Problem Definition F-35 fighter pilots occasionally experience Unexplained Physiological Events (UPEs) during high-G maneuvers, symptoms like dizziness, nausea, or perceived irregular heartbeats. These events raise critical concerns about the pilot's health and flight safety. However, determining whether these events are genuine cardiac arrhythmias or artifacts caused by stress, noise, or sensor malfunction is challenging. The scarcity of in-flight arrhythmia data further complicates the development of reliable diagnostic tools. Current machine learning models often fail to generalize across different sensor types and environmental conditions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. 2.2 Research Objective The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate an AI-based arrhythmia classification system capable of identifying abnormal heart rhythms in F-35 pilots under high-stress conditions. The system should be able to generalize from controlled training data to real-world, sensor-varied environments, ensuring reliability and minimizing both false negatives and false positives. 2.3 Main Research Question How can machine learning be used to accurately and reliably detect arrhythmias in F-35 pilots across different sensor types and operational environments? 2.4 Sub-questions What types of ECG data are most relevant for detecting arrhythmias in high-stress aviation contexts? What preprocessing steps are necessary to clean and normalize ECG data from varied sources? Which machine learning models are best suited for arrhythmia detection and why? How does

sensor types and operational environments? 2.4 Sub-questions What types of ECG data are most relevant for detecting arrhythmias in high-stress aviation contexts? What preprocessing steps are necessary to clean and normalize ECG data from varied sources? Which machine learning models are best suited for arrhythmia detection and why? How does the classifier perform on standard datasets, and how well does it generalize to unseen or synthetic data mimicking in-flight conditions? What design and deployment considerations must be addressed to integrate such a classifier into a cockpit monitoring system? 2.5 Coherence with Problem and Objectives The above research questions are directly derived from the core problem of unreliability in arrhythmia detection due to domain shift and data scarcity. Each sub-question addresses a necessary component of the objective, from data handling to model selection to practical deployment, ensuring a logically coherent path from problem identification to solution validation. 3. Methodology 3.1 Research Design This study follows an applied research design using a combination of experimental evaluation, dataset engineering, and model development. The approach includes preprocessing ECG data, selecting and evaluating classification models, and validating model performance in both controlled and cross-domain conditions. The goal is to simulate the operational challenges faced by F-35 pilots during high-G maneuvers and assess the robustness of the developed classifier under those constraints. 3.2 Data Sources Training Dataset: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database from PhysioNet, featuring clinically validated ECG data annotated by experts. It includes multiple types of arrhythmic and normal beats recorded in controlled hospital settings. Evaluation Dataset: To simulate real-world operational variance, we used subsets of ECG data from different activities (e.g., running, cycling) available on PhysioNet or synthetically modified ECG signals representing stress or motion artifacts. 3.3 Preprocessing Steps To ensure data consistency and minimize noise: Noise Filtering: Bandpass filtering (0.5–40 Hz) to eliminate baseline wander and high-frequency noise. Normalization: Z-score normalization of ECG amplitudes. Segmentation: Windowing around R-peaks with a fixed-length sampling window. Skipping Incomplete Data: Automatically ignoring corrupted or out-of-bound signal segments. These preprocessing steps were critical to ensure compatibility between training and evaluation domains. 3.4 Model Selection and Implementation We implemented and compared multiple models: Baseline: Logistic Regression, due to its simplicity and interpretability. Classical: Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), known for handling small to medium datasets. Deep Learning: CNN and LSTM models to learn spatial and temporal features.

multiple models: Baseline: Logistic Regression, due to its simplicity and interpretability. Classical: Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), known for handling small to medium datasets. Deep Learning: CNN and LSTM models to learn spatial and temporal features. Hybrid Model: A CNN + LSTM architecture was selected as the final classifier for its ability to capture both waveform morphology and time-based dependencies. All models were trained using Python libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. 3.5 Model Evaluation The model's effectiveness was assessed using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score – with a particular focus on performance for the minority class (arrhythmic beats). 5-Fold Cross-Validation – to evaluate model robustness and prevent overfitting. Confusion Matrix – to understand error types and model confidence. Additionally, domain generalization was tested by evaluating model performance on data distributions different from the training set. 3.6 Ethical Considerations Although no human data was collected directly, we ensured all datasets used were open-access, anonymized, and ethically cleared. The implications of deploying health-monitoring models in high-risk environments were also considered, particularly regarding false negatives and pilot safety. 4. Results 4.1 Baseline Performance The baseline model, Logistic Regression, was trained on the MIT-BIH dataset with stratified sampling to preserve class distribution. Despite class imbalance (98.5% normal vs. 1.5% arrhythmic), the model achieved a test accuracy of 99.7%, but this masked critical weaknesses. It missed 1 out of 5 abnormal beats, achieving a recall of only 0.80 for arrhythmias. This emphasizes the importance of using metrics beyond accuracy, especially for rare but clinically significant cases. 4.2 Classical Model Performance Random Forest: Showed excellent performance on training data but overfitted, performing poorly on evaluation datasets with unseen noise and class variation. SVM: Achieved slightly better generalization due to margin-based classification but still struggled under domain shift. These models confirmed previous findings: traditional models, while interpretable, fail to generalize well across domains (Shaw & Harrell, 2023). 4.3 Deep Learning Model Performance The CNN and LSTM models were evaluated separately: CNN captured waveform shapes well, achieving precision of 0.97 but only recall of 0.62 for arrhythmic beats. LSTM, intended to model sequence data, underperformed with a recall of only 0.03, due to overfitting and insufficient sequential pattern learning. 4.4 Hybrid CNN + LSTM Model The final model, combining CNN and LSTM layers, was designed to utilize CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal context. Performance metrics under 5-fold cross-validation were: Accuracy: 98.5% Precision (A): 1.00

recall of only 0.03, due to overfitting and insufficient sequential pattern learning. 4.4 Hybrid CNN + LSTM Model The final model, combining CNN and LSTM layers, was designed to utilize CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal context. Performance metrics under 5-fold cross-validation were: Accuracy: 98.5% Precision (A): 1.00 Recall (A): 0.86 F1-Score (A): 0.92 This hybrid model demonstrated high sensitivity to rare arrhythmic patterns, critical in medical and aviation contexts. 4.5 Generalization to New Domains When tested on domain-shifted datasets (e.g., ECG data with motion artifacts or different sensor types), only the CNN + LSTM model retained acceptable performance. While metrics dropped slightly, recall for arrhythmic events remained above 0.70, indicating robustness to signal variation. This validates findings from Chen et al. (2020) and Barker et al. (2024), confirming that hybrid and domain-adaptive models generalize better than traditional algorithms. 4.6 Model Limitations Class Imbalance: Despite class weighting and oversampling techniques, rare arrhythmias remain underrepresented. Black-box Nature: Deep learning models lack interpretability, making them less suitable for clinical deployment without additional explanation mechanisms. Synthetic Testing: Real in-flight data was unavailable; thus, domain generalization is based on approximated conditions. 5. Conclusions and Discussion 5.1 Summary of Findings This project successfully developed and evaluated a deep learning-based arrhythmia classification system designed to support health monitoring for F-35 fighter pilots. The final model, a hybrid CNN + LSTM architecture, was selected based on its ability to capture both morphological and temporal ECG features. It achieved strong performance on both controlled and domain-shifted datasets, reaching an F1-score of 0.92 for arrhythmias, far surpassing baseline and traditional models. 5.2 Key Contributions We demonstrated that traditional models (Random Forests, SVMs), although effective in narrow domains, do not generalize well to varied sensor inputs or physical conditions. Deep learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, are more resilient to domain shifts, confirming the need for advanced architectures in safety-critical applications. The study validated that ECG preprocessing and segmentation significantly affect classifier reliability, especially under noisy or non-stationary inputs—common in flight conditions. 5.3 Practical Implications This proof-of-concept indicates that real-time arrhythmia monitoring using AI is feasible and could be a valuable addition to pilot health systems. If integrated with cockpit equipment, it could offer live anomaly alerts, aiding early detection and reducing risk during high-G maneuvers. However, model interpretability remains a barrier. For clinical and operational acceptance, tools such as saliency maps or attention mechanisms must be integrated to

a valuable addition to pilot health systems. If integrated with cockpit equipment, it could offer live anomaly alerts, aiding early detection and reducing risk during high-G maneuvers. However, model interpretability remains a barrier. For clinical and operational acceptance, tools such as saliency maps or attention mechanisms must be integrated to clarify why a prediction was made. 5.4 Limitations No real flight ECG data was available, so generalizability is inferred from proxy datasets. The class imbalance in training data remains a challenge despite mitigation strategies like oversampling and class weighting. The system does not yet handle multi-class classification beyond binary normal/arrhythmic detection. 5.5 Recommendations To evolve this proof-of-concept toward a deployable product: Collect real-time ECG data from simulated or actual flights to validate model robustness further. Implement explainable AI methods to enhance user trust and clinical adoption. Enhance the model interface with pilot-centric feedback mechanisms and seamless integration into cockpit hardware. Investigate multi-class arrhythmia classification and explore physiological data fusion (e.g., oxygen saturation, respiration) to enrich predictions. 6.Customer satisfaction 6.1.Customer satisfaction form Assessment form communication and product satisfaction I = Insufficient, M = Mediocre, S= Sufficient, G = Good, E = Excellent 6.2 Reflection on Client Evaluation Our client, Maarten Schadd from TNO, provided a well-rounded and thoughtful assessment of both our communication and the technical product. Overall, the evaluation rated all criteria as at least sufficient, reflecting satisfaction with the quality of our solution and the analytical depth demonstrated throughout the project. A major strength highlighted was our independent exploration of additional datasets beyond the one originally provided. This proactive approach enhanced the validity of our findings and showcased our initiative. The client also appreciated our critical thinking and validation of model performance, especially our caution in interpreting seemingly high accuracy scores. This aligns with best practices in scientific modeling and reinforced the credibility of our results. However, the feedback also pointed to areas for improvement, particularly around communication dynamics. While we met expectations in terms of deliverables and follow-up, the client noted a lack of visible enthusiasm during meetings and occasional absences. This feedback is important: it suggests that clearer engagement and energy during interactions would help build a stronger collaborative impression, even when the technical work meets or exceeds expectations. Additionally, the client was surprised but ultimately impressed by our decision to use a single heartbeat signal instead of the anticipated 30-second window. Although the results validated this

clearer engagement and energy during interactions would help build a stronger collaborative impression, even when the technical work meets or exceeds expectations. Additionally, the client was surprised but ultimately impressed by our decision to use a single heartbeat signal instead of the anticipated 30-second window. Although the results validated this approach, the feedback suggests that such pivotal design choices should be discussed and aligned with stakeholders earlier in the process. In conclusion, while we demonstrated technical rigor and independence, the evaluation reminds us of the importance of consistent, energized communication and stakeholder alignment.

Future Directions: The study suggests improvements in ECG classification, including hybrid models and deep learning approaches. These insights can guide future iterations of our classifier, improving its effectiveness in dynamic environments. Impact of High-G Forces on Fighter Pilots' Heart Health Key Points: This study examines how high-G acceleration forces affect the heart’s structure and function in fighter pilots. Focuses on cardiac adaptations and potential risks like arrhythmias caused by extreme stress on the body. Analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) data and cardiac imaging from fighter pilots exposed to high-G environments. Evaluates how Anti-G Straining Maneuvers (AGSM) help protect heart function during flight. Why it matters? Fighter pilots experience intense physical stress. Understanding how high-G forces impact the heart helps improve pilot safety and health monitoring. Impact of High-G Forces on Fighter Pilots' Heart Health Key Findings: High-G exposure leads to increased heart rate, temporary changes in heart rhythm, and altered blood circulation. Some pilots showed mild structural heart changes, but no severe long-term damage was observed. AGSM (Anti-G Straining Maneuver) techniques effectively reduce heart strain and help maintain stable blood flow. Implications: Regular ECG monitoring and training for proper AGSM execution can reduce heart-related risks in fighter pilots. Further studies are needed to see if long-term exposure to high-G forces causes permanent heart changes. Relevance to F-35 Pilots: Pilots in high-performance jets like the F-35 face even higher G-forces, making this research crucial for improving pilot health protocols and flight safety. Cardiac Arrhythmias in F-16 Pilots During High-G Manoeuvres Key Points: Investigates how high-G forces impact heart rhythm in fighter pilots. Focuses on electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings taken during Aerial Combat Maneuvers (ACMs) in F-16 pilots. Examines the relationship between G-force exposure and arrhythmia occurrence. Why it matters? High-G forces affect the cardiovascular system. Understanding arrhythmia risks helps improve pilot health monitoring and flight safety. Cardiac Arrhythmias in F-16 Pilots During High-G Manoeuvres Key Findings: 45.7% of pilots experienced arrhythmias during high-G maneuvers. Most common arrhythmias: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) and Supraventricular Premature Beats (SVPBs). Arrhythmias occurred more frequently at higher G-levels but were generally benign and self-correcting. Implications: Routine ECG screening is essential for early detection of cardiac risks in fighter pilots. Proper training in Anti-G Straining Maneuvers (AGSM) may help reduce arrhythmia occurrence.

Proper training in Anti-G Straining Maneuvers (AGSM) may help reduce arrhythmia occurrence. Future research is needed to determine if long-term exposure to high-G forces increases serious heart risks. Relevance to F-35 Pilots: F-35 pilots face similar or higher G-forces. This study highlights the need for continuous heart health monitoring and improved pilot training. Relevance to the Project Detecting Arrhythmias in High-G Flight (F-16 Study) ➡ The study shows that 45.7% of fighter pilots experience arrhythmias during high-G maneuvers. ➡ To build an AI model for monitoring pilot health, we need to understand what types of arrhythmias occur, when they happen, and how they affect pilots. ➡ This knowledge helps in designing an AI system that can analyze real-time ECG data and alert pilots or medical teams to potential risks. Understanding Heart Changes & AI Prediction (High-G Forces Study) ➡ The study reveals that high-G forces cause temporary heart rhythm changes and possible structural effects. ➡ Our AI model needs to recognize patterns in these changes to predict when a pilot is at risk of a serious cardiac event. ➡ By using this research, we can train the AI to differentiate normal pilot heart adaptations from dangerous arrhythmias, improving early warning systems and pilot safety. Why it matters? Understanding how and why arrhythmias occur is essential to build an AI model that accurately detects, predicts, and prevents heart-related risks for F-35 pilots. Conclusion Conclusion High-G forces can impact heart function, causing temporary arrhythmias in fighter pilots. AI-based ECG analysis, including deep learning and zero-shot learning, improves real-time arrhythmia detection. Studies show that while arrhythmias are common under high-G conditions, they are usually self-correcting. Training techniques like the Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM) help reduce heart strain. Future research should focus on improving AI integration, sensor reliability, and long-term cardiac effects. Combining AI with routine monitoring can enhance pilot safety and performance in extreme conditions. References Rahul, J., & Sharma, L. D. (2025).

TECHNICAL, Functional and Graphical design Classifying Arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots APRIL 30, 2025 Group 3 Table of contents 1. Graphical Design (Design Concept) This is a concept dashboard for an arrhythmia classification model. It shows the main ideas and features you would include when presenting how the model works and how well it performs. The dashboard includes: Model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to show how reliable the predictions are. A confusion matrix to compare the actual vs. predicted classes and spot where the model makes mistakes. A class distribution chart to see how many ECG samples belong to each type of heart rhythm (like Normal, Arrhythmia). A per-class performance table to understand how well the model performs for each type of arrhythmia. An example of an ECG signal with a highlighted part showing what the model focused on and the predicted arrhythmia type with a confidence score. 2. Technical Design This proof-of-concept (PoC) aims to develop and demonstrate an arrythmia classification system that detects abnormal heartbeats such as premature or delayed ventricular contraction from ECG data. The system is designed for F-35 fighter pilots who may experience unexplained physiological events (UPEs) during high-stress, high-G maneuvers. Due to the sensitive and domain-specific nature of the applications, the solution must not only be accurate but also generalizable across varied conditions and sensor types. The PoC will showcase the technical feasibility of ESG signal analysis using machine learning. 2.1 Scope and Complexity 2.1.1 Problem Scope Classify ESG signals into normal and arrhythmic categories using labeled physiological data. 2.1.2 Complexity Factors Significant class imbalance: Only 1.5% of samples are arrhythmic. Domain shift: Training data from hospital environments must generalize to in-flight conditions. Need for interpretability and model transparency. 2.2 Architecture Overview 2.2.1 Data Layer Input Source: Cleaned dataset derived from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database Preprocessing: Bandpass filtering (0.5-40 Hz) to remove noise. Z-score normalization. Windowing around R-peaks.

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score Confusion Matrix Model Development Toolkits: Scikit-learn Numpy Pandas Matplotlib 2.2.3 Deployment and interface Layer 2.3 Tool Stack Justification 2.4 Scalability And Usability Considerations Scalability: While Streamlit is not optimized for concurrent production use, it’s well-suited for PoC. Future deployment could port to FastAPI with Kubernets for scalable microservices. Usability: Streamlit enables direct interaction with the model, making it ideal for: Model debugging Performance interpretation 2.5 Conclusion This technical design supports the creation of a robust, scalable, and interpretable PoC for arrythmia detection in high-G environments. The chosen tool stack ensures alignment with the problem’s scope and complexity while facilitating a smooth path to demonstration. 3. Functional design This chapter outlines the functional design of the proof-of-concept application developed for arrhythmia detection in F-35 pilots. The proposed solution was conceptualized and structured using a range of UML diagrams to clarify both the user interaction and the internal system behavior. The aim is to ensure that the application design is transparent, logically structured, and functionally sufficient for the complexity of the problem at hand. 3.1. Functional flow of the application The application logic begins with a check for available data. If no data is found, the system issues an error message and stops. If data is available, the process moves forward through several stages handled by both the developer and system components. The process flow has been deliberately designed to ensure reliability, control, and iterative feedback, which are crucial in high-stakes environments like fighter aviation. The following design choices reflect these priorities: Initial data check The process starts with a check to see if the data is found. This ensures that all downstream operations only run if valid ECG data exists. In high-reliability systems, failing early is critical, hence the system immediately issues an error and stops if no data is found. Automated data preprocessing Once data is confirmed, the system automatically proceeds through predefined preprocessing steps. These include noise filtering and signal normalization, which are essential for handling raw ECG signals, particularly in high-G environments where motion artifacts and signal distortion are common. Automating this ensures consistency and reproducibility while reducing the risk of human error. Training is distinct from tuning The training stage is kept separate from performance evaluation and tuning. This allows for isolation of model-building from model-assessment logic and aligns with common machine learning pipelines. It reflects a research-first

common. Automating this ensures consistency and reproducibility while reducing the risk of human error. Training is distinct from tuning The training stage is kept separate from performance evaluation and tuning. This allows for isolation of model-building from model-assessment logic and aligns with common machine learning pipelines. It reflects a research-first mindset, where training and iterative evaluation are not automated until final validation. Iterative performance check After training, the system evaluates model performance based on metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score. If the model underperforms, the system initiates an automated hyperparameter tuning cycle. This feedback loop continues until a satisfactory result is achieved. This design supports progressive improvement while preserving traceability of each training iteration. User confirmation to save A final step lets the user (developer) explicitly choose to save the model if performance is good. This manual checkpoint ensures traceability and verification, rather than allowing models to be saved automatically. This flow strikes a balance between automated processing for efficiency and manual validation for safety, aligning with best practices in medical and defense-grade software systems. 3.2. System Architecture and Class Structure The application includes multiple components for handling different functional aspects of the arrhythmia prediction system. The class diagram below presents the relationship between system entities such as patient data, ECG signals, preprocessing, and classification logic. The system’s architecture reflects a pipeline-based, layered modular design, with components corresponding to real-world data and processing stages: Separation of Domain Data and Logic Patient and HeartbeatSignal are modeled as independent data classes. This supports modular data loading, easy dataset expansion, and patient-level tracking. HeartbeatSignal is decoupled from preprocessing, allowing raw data to be preserved for reproducibility and auditability which is important for clinical evaluation. Preprocessing as a Dedicated Class Preprocessor handles both noise removal and normalization. Abstracting these tasks allows for swappable preprocessing strategies and testability. Keeping this logic separate avoids polluting the main pipeline (ArrhythmiaDetectorSystem) with low-level signal operations. Explicit Feature Engineering The FeatureExtractor is separated from the classifier. This decision allows experimentation with different signal representation strategies (e.g., time-domain vs. frequency-domain features), supporting research flexibility. Classifier Encapsulation Classifier houses all ML model logic (training, prediction, evaluation). This encapsulation isolates learning logic from other system concerns. It aligns with clean architecture practices and allows for easier testing and replacement of the model (e.g., swapping a CNN for a Random Forest).

model logic (training, prediction, evaluation). This encapsulation isolates learning logic from other system concerns. It aligns with clean architecture practices and allows for easier testing and replacement of the model (e.g., swapping a CNN for a Random Forest). Evaluation as a Standalone Class The EvaluationMetrics class captures output performance in a structured, reusable format. This abstraction allows consistent access to model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, supporting both automated testing and manual inspection. Pipeline Controller (ArrhythmiaDetectorSystem) This central controller manages the end-to-end flow: loading data, running the pipeline, and generating predictions. It orchestrates the other components without holding implementation logic, following the single responsibility principle. This architectural structure ensures testability, replaceability, and readability, making the system suitable for iterative development and adaptation to new domains or datasets.

Train model report Classifying Arrhythmia in Fighter Pilots APRIL 4, 2025 Group 3 Contents Introduction Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are vital for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities such as arrhythmias. Automating this classification process can improve early detection and reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. In this project, we investigate machine learning and deep learning methods to classify ECG signals into two categories: normal and abnormal heartbeats. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, where normal beats dominate, model evaluation requires careful attention. This report presents a systematic approach to selecting and implementing an effective classification model, starting with a basic logistic regression and culminating in a more advanced hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The report begins with an analysis of model performance, where the results of logistic regression are compared against the baseline accuracy, and the challenges caused by class imbalance are discussed. This is followed by model selection, which provides a comparison between different models suitable for ECG classification and explains the motivation behind choosing the hybrid CNN + LSTM architecture. Finally, the model implementation section outlines the preprocessing steps, architectural design, training process, and parameter choices used to build the final model, accompanied by code snippets and visuals for clarity. Together, these sections highlight the rationale behind our approach and provide a comprehensive view of how deep learning techniques can be effectively applied to ECG classification tasks. 1.Model Performance In binary classification tasks, the baseline accuracy refers to the performance achieved by always predicting the most frequent class in the dataset. It serves as a simple benchmark to evaluate whether a trained model provides any added value. In our case, the dataset consists of two classes: N (Normal) A (Abnormal) Out of all instances: 98.5% belonged to class 'N' 1.5% belonged to class 'A' If we were to always predict 'N', we would achieve a baseline accuracy of: 98,5% However, this strategy would completely fail to detect abnormal heartbeats (class 'A'), which are the most critical cases to identify in medical diagnostics. We used Logistic Regression as a baseline model. The data was split as follows: 70% for training 15% for validation 15% for testing (with stratification to preserve class distribution) The model was trained with class_weight="balanced" to compensate for the class imbalance. After training, the model achieved an accuracy score of 0.9971 on the test set. While this

model. The data was split as follows: 70% for training 15% for validation 15% for testing (with stratification to preserve class distribution) The model was trained with class_weight="balanced" to compensate for the class imbalance. After training, the model achieved an accuracy score of 0.9971 on the test set. While this result appears excellent, it must be interpreted with caution. The dataset is heavily biased toward normal heartbeats, and the test set contained very few abnormal samples. As a result, the model achieved a high score which mostly reflects the correct classification of normal heartbeats. The initial performance metrics on the test set showed as follows: These metrics show that while the model performed well on normal beats, it missed 1 out of 5 abnormal cases, which is crucial in real-world ECG monitoring scenarios. This underlines the limitations of accuracy alone and the importance of recall and F1-score for minority classes. To assess generalizability, we applied 5-fold cross-validation. This method helps identify overfitting or fluctuations in performance across different data splits, especially for the rare class 'A'. The model consistently achieved high accuracy (~99.5%) and excellent precision for abnormal heartbeats across all folds. However, recall varied more significantly, ranging from 0.57 to 0.86. This variation reveals an important insight: while the model is highly reliable when it predicts an abnormality (high precision), it sometimes fails to detect abnormal heartbeats at all (lower recall). This is especially critical in medical applications, where missing an arrhythmia can have serious consequences. These findings highlight the limitations of relying on accuracy alone and support the need for exploring more advanced models, such as CNNs and LSTMs, which are better equipped to capture subtle and complex patterns in ECG data — particularly those present in the minority class. Areas for Improvement Dataset Imbalance: The extreme class imbalance limits the model’s ability to learn and detect abnormal heartbeats effectively. Collecting more samples of abnormal heartbeats (class 'A') would improve the model’s ability to generalize and make reliable predictions across both classes. Data Augmentation: Techniques like SMOTE or synthetic ECG generation could help balance the dataset and reduce overfitting to the majority class. These findings highlight the limitations of relying on accuracy alone and emphasize the importance of models that can better capture rare but clinically important patterns. Based on this insight, we next explore and compare several machine learning and deep learning architectures to identify a more

overfitting to the majority class. These findings highlight the limitations of relying on accuracy alone and emphasize the importance of models that can better capture rare but clinically important patterns. Based on this insight, we next explore and compare several machine learning and deep learning architectures to identify a more effective solution. 2.Model Selection For this project, we explored multiple models to classify ECG signals effectively. The following models were trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) Hybrid CNN + LSTM model Model Comparison: Logistic Regression We began with Logistic Regression as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability. It assumes a linear relationship between input features and the output class. Pros: Fast to train and easy to implement Requires fewer computational resources Provides a clear baseline for comparison Cons: Assumes linearity, which is often unrealistic for time-series biomedical data Limited ability to capture complex patterns in ECG signals Struggles with imbalanced datasets without careful tuning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Next, we implemented a Convolutional Neural Network, a popular architecture for processing sequential and spatial data like ECG signals. CNNs are effective at automatically extracting local features through filters and pooling layers. Pros: Captures local patterns such as sharp peaks or dips in ECG signals Learns features directly from raw or minimally processed input Performs well on structured data like 1D signal sequences Cons: Requires more data and training time than classical models May miss long-term dependencies across the signal without additional layers Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) We also tested a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. Pros: Effective at modeling time-based dependencies in ECG data Handles variable-length input sequences Complements CNNs by analyzing sequential patterns over time Cons: Computationally heavier and slower to train Requires more careful tuning and regularization Hybrid Model (CNN + LSTM) For the final model, we selected a hybrid CNN + LSTM architecture, combining the strengths of both approaches: The CNN extracts local features from the ECG signal The LSTM captures temporal relationships between those features over time This hybrid approach is well-suited for ECG classification, as it can both detect important waveform shapes and understand their sequence within the heartbeat signal. To objectively compare the models, all of them were assessed using a 5-fold cross-validation. The following table summarizes the average

relationships between those features over time This hybrid approach is well-suited for ECG classification, as it can both detect important waveform shapes and understand their sequence within the heartbeat signal. To objectively compare the models, all of them were assessed using a 5-fold cross-validation. The following table summarizes the average performance across folds, focusing on metrics most relevant to medical anomaly detection: precision, recall and F1-score for the minority class. This method provides a consistent basis for comparison and avoids biases that might result from a single train-test split. The table above summarizes the performance of each model, with an emphasis on metrics relevant to the minority class — abnormal heartbeats (A). Logistic Regression, although a simple model, achieved strong and consistent performance with a recall of 0.77 and F1 score of 0.84, indicating a solid ability to detect abnormalities across folds. The CNN model reached the highest precision (0.97) for abnormal cases, showing it made very few false positive predictions. However, its recall was lower (0.62), suggesting it often missed actual abnormal cases — a critical issue in medical diagnostics. The LSTM model performed poorly on the minority class, with an average F1 score of just 0.06, indicating its limited effectiveness under the current setup. Most notably, the CNN + LSTM hybrid model failed to detect any abnormal cases across all folds, resulting in zero precision, recall, and F1 score for class A. This reflects the challenges these deep learning models faced in learning from a highly imbalanced dataset without additional class-balancing techniques. These findings reinforce the importance of model simplicity in the presence of class imbalance. Logistic Regression, in this context, provided the most reliable performance, while more complex models may require further tuning, class weighting, or data augmentation to be viable alternatives. Model Selection Despite its failure to detect abnormal heartbeats in our current evaluation, the CNN + LSTM model was selected due to its architectural strengths and support in scientific literature. The hybrid architecture combines CNN’s strength in extracting spatial features from ECG waveforms with LSTM’s ability to learn temporal dependencies, a synergy that aligns well with the sequential nature of ECG data. Research by Rahul & Sharma (2025) and Denysyuk et al. (2023) demonstrates the potential of such hybrid models, particularly when supported by larger datasets and appropriate class-balancing techniques. Additionally, in high-performance aviation contexts such as fighter pilot monitoring, the ability to capture non-linear,

with the sequential nature of ECG data. Research by Rahul & Sharma (2025) and Denysyuk et al. (2023) demonstrates the potential of such hybrid models, particularly when supported by larger datasets and appropriate class-balancing techniques. Additionally, in high-performance aviation contexts such as fighter pilot monitoring, the ability to capture non-linear, high-frequency variations is essential. Soh et al. (2024) note that physiological monitoring in these environments benefits from more advanced AI models capable of adapting to extreme conditions. Therefore, while the CNN + LSTM model underperformed in our current configuration, it remains a strategically sound choice for future development and deployment, particularly with further optimization, data augmentation, and class imbalance mitigation. Discussion and future work While this project demonstrated promising results, particularly with Logistic Regression, the selected CNN + LSTM hybrid model faced notable challenges in detecting abnormal heartbeats. These limitations offer valuable insight into the constraints of deep learning when working with imbalanced medical datasets. The table below summarizes the key issues encountered during model development and evaluation, along with recommended strategies for addressing them in future iterations of this project. Addressing these limitations would likely improve the deep learning models’ ability to detect arrhythmias, especially in complex or real-time scenarios such as those involving high-performance fighter pilots. Other studies, such as Daydulo et al. (2023), have also demonstrated the viability of deep learning approaches for arrhythmia detection using time-frequency features, reinforcing the potential of CNN and LSTM-based architectures when supported by appropriate signal representation and tuning. 3. Model Implementation In this chapter, we describe the steps taken to implement the chosen hybrid CNN + LSTM model for ECG classification. The implementation was carried out in Python using TensorFlow/Keras, with attention to code clarity, data preprocessing, and appropriate parameter tuning. Data Preprocessing The ECG dataset was first standardized to ensure all features had zero mean and unit variance. This step is crucial for neural networks, as unscaled input data can negatively impact model convergence. After scaling, the data was reshaped to fit the CNN + LSTM input format. Each sample was reshaped to a 2D array (samples, time_steps, channels). Neural networks like CNN and LSTM expect input in the format (samples, time_steps, channels). This reshaping step prepares the data accordingly, where each heartbeat sample becomes a 2D time series with one feature channel. Model Architecture The hybrid model consists of: 1D Convolutional layers to extract local ECG patterns MaxPooling layers
